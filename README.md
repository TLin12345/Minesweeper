# Minesweeper
1. In this Project, you will implement the “Neat Office” application. The main frame is divided into three main panels hosting a Calculator, a Day 
Counter and a Graph Operator.
2. Create a menu that contains “Save File”, “Open File”, “Modify Appearance” and “Help” items. Each of those items also contains relevant subitems 
for users.
3. In the Calculator panel, not only can the user perform the calculation, but also store or clear or print the calculation history, and change the 
panel color based on the user's needs.
4. In the Day Counter panel, the user can count the days according to two different dates, and the panel can display the time of the current region.
5. In the Graph Section panel, the user can import either a .txt or .csv file that contain the graph information into a list box. Then, the user can 
select the graph from the list box and do the operation of mining spanning tree or SSSP to get the shortest path results and save them to another list 
box. Also, the Graph Section allows users to save or print the shortest path results.
